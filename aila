“One cannot transform a world except as individuals in the world are transformed, and individuals cannot be changed except as they are molded in the hands of the Master.” Jesus chose 12. He had taught them everything needed to usher the crowd to God’s Kingdom. This does not mean that He cannot tolerate such a crowd, but instead He first laid the very foundation of God’s master plan to His 12 devoted disciples and He had been wise to use them in disseminating it to the crowd.
